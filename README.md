# HFOs-Identification-Imaging
## About the project
The software codes and sample data (clinical and simulation) have been developed under support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) via grants NS096761, EB021027, MH114233, AT009263, and EB029354 awarded to Dr. Bin He.

The sample human data, which is deidentified, were collected as part of the NIH funded research at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, overseen by Dr. Gregory A. Worrell.

## Testing and examples
See README.txt or README.pdf for more details.
1. Download codes and data.
2. Unzip the data folder from data_zip (also see [data/README.md](/data_zip/README.md)).
3. Download and deploy necessary tooloboxes and functions (also see [toolbox/README.md](/toolbox/README.md)).
4. Add the ROOT folder to Matlab dependency.
5. Run "main_hfoDetection.m" for examples of HFOs identification.
6. Run "main_hfoImaging.m" for examples of HFOs/spike imaging.
