Due to the size limit for each gsingle file, the whole data is compressed into a few ".zip" files in this folder.
Before running the program, please unzip the files under the ROOT folder of the program.
Also note that the folder "data" should be placed under the RROT folder and it has three subfolders, namely, "imaging", "process", and "raw".
