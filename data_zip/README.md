Due to the size limit for each gsingle file, the whole data is compressed into a few ".zip" files in this folder.
Before running the program, please unzip the files under the ROOT folder of the program.
Also note that the folder "data" should be placed under the RROT folder and it has three subfolders, namely, "imaging", "process", and "raw".
The leadfield data is contained in the Raw folder, and the detailed data structure could be found and visualized by using leadField.m script, which was automatically generated by Curry 7 software.
